# Dynamic_Harmonic_Regression
The results of Maxwell et al. 2023 reported harmonic regression coefficients as a means to summarize spectral time series data. Based on this study, harmonic regression coefficients generally provided better predictive performance for differentiating forest community types. This research suggests that harmonic regression is an effective means to summarize seasonal and phenological patterns in a multispectral timeseries.
